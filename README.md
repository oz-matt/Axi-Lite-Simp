Single transaction demonstration for AXI Lite master and slave. Low bandwidth. Meant as a skeleton for simple AXI Lite slaves or masters.

Tested on the Zynq-7000 ZedBoard using the Xilinx SDK.

The implemented design demonstrates a simple 4x256 byte master/slave memory controller. Code can be adjusted to support bursting or expanded back end functionality.
